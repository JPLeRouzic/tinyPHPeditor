This is a PHP bare-bone editor in the spirit of TinyMCE. It's just a toy PHP page that you have to adapt to your own project.
Currently it reads the content to edit from a file, enables basic edition, there is no "save" feature.
In a real application the content comes from a database or from a user form, and saving it depends on what your application is intended to use it.
So there is no point in providing to read or save the content.
